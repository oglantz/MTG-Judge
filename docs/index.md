**Magic: The Gathering has a lot of rules, and they're all weird. Interpretering them is a hard enough task that if you want to be a real judge, you must pass multiple exams. We propose an application driven project leveraging LLM's, Vector DBs, and RL based fine-tuning to make a system that takes in a properly formatted MTG rules question, and outputs a clear, concise, accurate ruling.**
