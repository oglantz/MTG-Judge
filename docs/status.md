## Project Summary

<!-- Short paragraph: main idea, updated/clarified from proposal. -->

## Approach

## Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation setup (quantitative and qualitative). Results, plots, charts, tables, screenshots. At least 1–2 paragraphs per evaluation type. -->

## Remaining Goals and Challenges

<!-- Goals for the rest of the quarter; limitations of current prototype; what to add for a complete contribution; comparison with other methods if applicable. Challenges you anticipate, how blocking they might be, and how you might overcome them. -->

## Resources Used

<!-- Code docs, libraries, source code, StackOverflow, etc. Include a comprehensive description of any use of AI tools. -->
